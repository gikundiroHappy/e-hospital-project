    <h1 style="color: orange;" >About E-hospital</h1>
    <p>This hospital was established in 1999 by gmmm. It was established with the intention of taking care of patients in possible ways
        in order to improve their way of living. As we know prevention is better than cure so this was made such that people can come
        as they are not felling well so that they can be able to know the position of there body by taking different tests such that when they
        find that they are sick they can take the medication once it is still early for that disease to be cured.
