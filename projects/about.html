    <div style="font-size: 25px;">
    <p >This hospital was established in 2022 by Angel. It was established with the intention of taking care of patients in possible ways
        in order to improve their way of living. As we know prevention is better than cure so this was made such that people can come
        as they are not felling well so that they can be able to know the position of there body by taking different tests such that when they
        find that they are sick they can take the medication once it is still early for that disease to be cured. <br> <br> We will coordinate your 
        care with additional services if that becomes necessary including specialty care, hospital stays, home health care, community services 
        and other supports. <br> <br> We promise that you will have access to our services with shorter waiting times, after hours care, 24/7 
        electronic or telephone access and strong, reliable, confidential communication through the patient login link on our website.
